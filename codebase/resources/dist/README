Distribution Resources
------------------------
When building distribution packages, there is a lot more than just
compiled code that needs to be incldued. These directories exist as
a place to store distribution-specific resources.

By convention, there are two types of directories here:

  * "common"   -- Contents copied into every distribution
  * "distname" -- Directory names to match distribution and
                  contains resources specific to a distribution

For example, you might see a set of sub-directories like so:

  dist/
    common/        -- Common resources
	retail/        -- Resources for a standard Retail dist
	enterprise/    -- Resources for an unlicensed Enterprise dist
