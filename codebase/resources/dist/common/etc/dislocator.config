# ================================
# Dislocator Configuration File
# ================================
# This file contains all available configuration options for the Disco Dislocator: A tool
# that tracks a specific entity on the DIS network and makes its location available via a
# TCP socket server, publishing in NEMA 0183 format. This is intended primarily for use with
# the Falcon View moving map feature, allowing you to attach the map to the location of any
# DIS entity (identified by marking).
#
# All options are formatted as name=value pairs, the '#' and '!' characters mark comment lines
#

# =========================================
# 1. General Settingss
# =========================================

# (1.1) Dislocator Mode
#        The Dislocator has two modes:
#          * Network: Listen to DIS network and replay matching PDUs in NMEA format
#          *    File: Replay from Disco recorded session file. If set to this, the
#                     property dislocator.sessionFile must be set.
#
#        DEFAULT: Network
#
dislocator.mode = Network

# (1.2) Tracking Entity
#        The value to use when determining which entity we should be tracking.
#        When we find an entity with its marking field set to the same as this
#        value, we publish its location to all listeners on the TCP/IP server.
#
dislocator.tracking = <marking>

# (1.3) Session File
#        The Disco session file to replay and extract from rather than listening
#        to the network. Only valid if mode is "File".
#
dislocator.sessionFile = duplicator.session

# (1.4) Dislocator Logging
#        Log level and file for the Disruptor. If the path is not an absolute location,
#        then path is relative to execution directory.
#
dislocator.loglevel = INFO
dislocator.logfile  = logs/dislocator.log

# (1.5) Disco Log Level
#        The level at which the Disco library should log its stuff
#        DEFAULT: INFO
#
dislocator.disco.loglevel = INFO


# =========================================
# 2. DIS Network Settings
# =========================================
#
# (2.1) DIS Address 
#        The network address that we will watch for DIS traffic on.
#        Valid values are:
#           * BROADCAST            - Use broadcast address for the NIC
#           * <Multicast Address>  - Use a specific multicast address
#
#        If you would like to use the broadcast address, don't configure it directly.
#        Just set this value to BROADCAST and it will be determined from the NIC.
#
dislocator.dis.address = BROADCAST

# (2.2) DIS Port
#        The port that we will listen for traffic on
#        DEFAULT: 3000
#
dislocator.dis.port = 3000

# (2.3) Network Interface
#        Define the particular network interface to use. This can be done via
#        a special constant, or you can specify an IP address that is bound to
#        the NIC. Valid values are:
#
#            GLOBAL: Pick a global IP address if available. If not, falls back to a SITE_LOCAL IP address.
#        SITE_LOCAL: Picks a site local (non routable) IP address, e.g. from the 192.168.0.0 or 10.0.0.0 address range.
#        LINK_LOCAL: Picks a link-local IP address, from 169.254.1.0 through 169.254.254.255.
#          LOOPBACK: Pick a loopback address, e.g. 127.0.0.1.
#         <ADDRESS>: Define a specific IP address that the NIC is bound to
#
#        DEFAULT: SITE_LOCAL
#
dislocator.dis.nic = SITE_LOCAL


# =========================================
# 3. NEMA TCP Server Settings
# =========================================

# (3.1) Server Address and Port
#        The address of the local NIC to listen for incoming connections on.
#        You can use either the IP address, or one of the symbolic names to
#        to identify the device: LOOPBACK, LINK_LOCAL, SITE_LOCAL, GLOBAL.
#
#        DEFAULT: SITE_LOCAL (address)
#        DEFAULT: 2999       (port)
#
dislocator.tcp.address = LOOPBACK
dislocator.tcp.port    = 2999

# (3.2) Ping Interval
#        The server will only output to each client at a fixed interval.
#        This ping happens whether the tracked entity is moving or not.
#        This setting lets you set that interval. Setting is in millis.
#
dislocator.nmea.interval = 1000

# (3.3) NMEA Output Format
#        The output record format that the NMEA server will provide for
#        position information. One of:
#          * RMC - Recommended minimum specific GPS/Transit data
#          * GGA - Global Positioning System Fix Data
#          * GLL - Geographic position, latitude / longitude
#
#        Note that due to Falcon View requirements, we will always output
#        VTG sentences.
#
#        Verify with: https://rl.se/gprmc
#
#        DEFAULT: RMC
#
dislocator.nmea.format = RMC

# (3.4) NMEA Output Time Zone
#        NMEA messages often contain a time. This sets the time zone
#        that we want to use for generating those messages. It can be
#        set to either "local" or "utc".
#
#        DEFAULT: utc
#
dislocator.nmea.timezone = utc
