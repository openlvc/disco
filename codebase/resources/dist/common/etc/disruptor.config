# =========================================
# 1. General Settingss
# =========================================

# (1.1) Disruptor Logging
#        Log level and file for the Disruptor. If the path is not an absolute location,
#        then path is relative to execution directory.
#
disruptor.loglevel = INFO
disruptor.logfile  = logs/disruptor.log

# (1.2) Disco Log Level
#        The level at which the Disco library should log its stuff
#        DEFAULT: INFO
#
disruptor.disco.loglevel = INFO


# =========================================
# 2. DIS & Network Settings
# =========================================
#
# (4.1) DIS Address 
#        The network address that the collector will source data from.
#        Valid values are:
#           * BROADCAST            - Use broadcast address for the NIC
#           * <Multicast Address>  - Use a specific multicast address
#
#        If you would like to use the broadcast address, don't configure it directly.
#        Just set this value to BROADCAST and it will be determined from the NIC.
#
disruptor.dis.address = BROADCAST

# (4.2) DIS Port
#        The port that the collector will listen for traffic on
#        DEFAULT: 3000
#
disruptor.dis.port = 3000

# (4.3) Network Interface
#        Define the particular network interface to use. This can be done via
#        a special constant, or you can specify an IP address that is bound to
#        the NIC. Valid values are:
#
#            GLOBAL: Pick a global IP address if available. If not, falls back to a SITE_LOCAL IP address.
#        SITE_LOCAL: Picks a site local (non routable) IP address, e.g. from the 192.168.0.0 or 10.0.0.0 address range.
#        LINK_LOCAL: Picks a link-local IP address, from 169.254.1.0 through 169.254.254.255.
#          LOOPBACK: Pick a loopback address, e.g. 127.0.0.1.
#         <ADDRESS>: Define a specific IP address that the NIC is bound to
#
#        DEFAULT: SITE_LOCAL
#
disruptor.dis.nic = SITE_LOCAL
